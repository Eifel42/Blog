# Protect your Network with Pi-Hole

The Pi-holeÂ® project is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. 
The project can use as an ad blocker for each device on a network. It can also block particular domains for internet access (e.g., known malware, spyware, ransomware, youth protection, Etc.).

The Domain Name System (DNS) finds the internet address of a domain name. Pi-Hole can use as a Domain Name System. The users can switch between a bunch of DNS providers.
It is also possible to set up to own clients to DNS providers.
